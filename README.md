Home Automation System using Internet of Things
Main Objective
A home automation system using the internet, thereby creating a smart house.

Specific Objectives
Desiging a Simple Sub-System

Intrusion Alert: The system alerts the user with a sound from a buzzer when a motion sensor detects movement or when a door/window sensor is triggered.
Automatic Lighting: The system will automatically enable lights when motion is detected.
User Notifications: The system will send notifications to the user.
Develop the Intruder Alert and Lighting Systems

Implementing the necessary hardware and software components to detect intrusions and control lighting.
Integrating Sub-Systems with Mobile Phone

Ensuring that the system can be controlled and monitored via a mobile phone application.
Test the Security and Lighting Systems

Conducting thorough testing to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the security and lighting systems.
Designing and Developing a Model House for the System

Creating a physical model house to demonstrate the functionality of the home automation system.
Features
Intrusion Detection: Alerts with a buzzer sound upon detecting unauthorized entry.
Automatic Lighting: Lights up the house when motion is detected.
Mobile Notifications: Sends real-time notifications to the user's mobile phone.
Mobile Integration: Full control and monitoring through a mobile application.
Model House: Physical demonstration of the system in a model house.
Installation
Hardware Setup:

Connect motion sensors(PIR Sensors), door/window sensors, buzzers, and lights as per the circuit design.
Ensure proper power supply and connections.
Software Setup:

Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller.
Set up the mobile application using the provided instructions.
Integration:

Ensure that the microcontroller and mobile application are connected to the same network.
Test the system by triggering the sensors and observing the responses.
Usage
Intrusion Detection: When the system detects motion or a triggered door/window sensor, it will sound the buzzer and send a notification to the userâ€™s phone.
Automatic Lighting: The system will automatically turn on the lights when motion is detected.
Mobile Control: Use the mobile application to monitor and control the system remotely.
Testing
Intrusion Alert: Simulate intrusions and ensure the buzzer sounds and notifications are sent.
Lighting System: Walk through the detection area to ensure lights turn on automatically.
Mobile Integration: Test the mobile application to ensure it accurately reflects the system's status and allows for control.
Model House
The model house will showcase the integration and functionality of the home automation system in a controlled environment.
